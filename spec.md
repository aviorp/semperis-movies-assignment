   movies or start searching for movies (depending on the API), including details such as
   title, release year, genre, and rating.
2. Search and Filter: Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for movies
   by title or genre. Additionally, users should be able to filter movies based on criteria such
   as release year or rating.
3. Movie Details: When a user clicks on a movie, they should be able to view detailed
   information about the movie, including a synopsis, cast, director, and any other relevant
   details. (If you choose Marvel, it can be whatever details about the character that you
   want from the API).
   Requirements:
   • Use modern frontend technologies such as Vue (Preferred), React, or Angular for
   building the application.2
   • Use TypeScript.
   • Utilize an open API to fetch movie/marvel characters data. You can use publicly
   available APIs like The Movie Database (TMDb), OMDB API or Marvel API.
   • Implement state management using Pinia, Redux, Vuex, or any other suitable library.
   • Adhere to best practices for code organization, readability, and maintainability.
   • Provide a polished user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
   • Overall creativity and innovation in solving the problem.
   Submission:
   • Share a GitHub repository containing the source code, along with instructions on how to
   run the application locally.
   • Bonus points:
   • Add unit tests for your components.
   • Deploy to a free hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
   Include the deployed URL in your README.
   Good luck
